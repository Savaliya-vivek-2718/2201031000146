<center><h1>Porsche 911 GT3 RS 2023 Review</h1></center>
<center>
	<p>The all-new 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS is the sixth instalment of a hallowed racer-for-the-road lineage (excluding the last Mezger-powered ‘4.0’<br> limited-edition of 2011) that began with the 996-series GT3 RS of 2003 and also includes the wide-body 997-series of 2006,<br> the upgraded 997.2 of 2009, the PDK-only 991-series of 2015, and the 991.2 version that brought the new 9A1.5 engine and Weissach package for the first time in 2018. <br>All of them have followed the same stripped-out, track-ready formula including a naturally-aspirated 4.0-litre flat-six and rear-wheel drive, but the new 992-series RS – based on the new GT3 <br>of 2022 – adds the wildest aero package ever seen on a road-going factory Porsche.</p></p>
</center>
<img class="vv" src="C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\images (2).jpg"><p> <ul> <li type="disc"> Based on the latest 992-series GT3 released last year, the 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 <br>RS was revealed in August 2022, launched in <br>Europe in October 2022 and proved to be 10.6 seconds faster than the standard GT3 at the Nurburgring later that month</li></ul></p>

<h2><i><b>Pors</b></i></h2>
<ul type="circle";>
	<li>Bespoke bodywork screams it’s special</li>
	<li>Race car aerodynamics for the road</li>
	<li>Endless chassis settings for track use</li>
</ul>
<h2><i><b>Cons</b></i></h2>
<ul type="circle";>
	<li>Lacks important safety features of other 911s</li>
	<li>Massive price increase puts it in Ferrari and Lambo territory</li>
	<li>Unless you’ve placed an order you’ve probably missed out</li>
</ul>
<p1><ul type="disc";><li>That’s a huge <b>$120,200</b> more than its donor model (despite similar price hikes for the regular GT3), pricier than a Carrera Cup racer <b>(about $450K)</b> and just $1100 less than the 911 Turbo S flagship.<br> And perhaps more importantly, <br>it puts the latest GT3 RS in<br> similar price territory to track-focused rivals like the <b><I>Ferrari 296 GTB</I></b> (from $568,300) and Lamborghini Huracan STO <b>(from $607,920)</b>.</li></ul></p1>
<ul type="circle";>
	<li>Yes, the <b>RS drives like any other rear-engined 911 and loves to be braked deep</b> into corners, <br>transferring the weight forward for maximum front-end bite</li>
	<li>Likewise, the different diff modes is very F1-like and, for example, lets you tighten the locking mechanism </li>
	<li>Of course, there are no rear seats under the rear roll cage, <br>but that makes even more space for the stuff you can no longer put under the bonnet.</li>
