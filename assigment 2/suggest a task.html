		<h1><b>RS: aerodynamics</b></h1>
		<p>Honed in a wind tunnel, the new GT3 RS has a number of <br>ground-breaking aero aids that generates a record downforce <br>– 860kg at 285kph, according to the company.</p>
		<p>That sort of air pressure may be good around corners,<br>but not on the straights, and hence, to give you the best of both worlds <br>– downforce in corners and low drag down the straights <br>– Porsche has brought F1 tech to you.</p>
	</center>
	<ul><li><p><i>This is the first Porsche to have a Drag Reduction System (DRS), which activates automatically or with the push of a button. Apart from making you feel like Messrs Hamilton and Verstappen, it optimises the car’s aero efficiency around a circuit in the quest for the best lap time.</i></p></li></ul>

				The ESC was firmly on to keep me from spinning wildly. It’s in the rain that you can really test and even enjoy the nine levels of traction control.<br>

				<br>To be honest, I was too busy trying to keep up with the pro driver in the pace car to play around with the multiple e-diff, suspension and traction control settings.<b> But I managed to find a nice balance of getting a good amount</b> of sideways action and armfuls of opposite lock to feel like a pro myself.
