	<b><h1>Porsche 911 GT3</h1></b>
	<p>The "GT3" nameplate was introduced in 1999 as part of the first generation of the Porsche 996 model range (commonly known as 996.1[2]) as a homologation model for the cars entered in the FIA GT3 cup. <br>As with Porsche's previous 911 RS models,<br> the 996 GT3 was focused on racing, and so was devoid of items that added unnecessary weight to the car.<br> Sound deadening was almost completely removed, as were the rear seats, rear loud speakers, sunroof, and air conditioning, although automatic air conditioning and CD/radio became no-cost optional add-ons.</p>
	<p>Because the 911 air-cooled crankcase uses the Porsche 356 engine to transmission mounting flange configuration, the 996 GT3 used a <br>6-speed manual gearbox also of air-cooled 911 heritage. <br>This gearbox has interchangeable gear ratios and is more durable making it more suitable for racing than the standard type 996 gearbox</p>
